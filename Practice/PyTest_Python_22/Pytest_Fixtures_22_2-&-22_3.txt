** How to work with PyTest Fixtures

    * The purpose of test fixtures is to provide a fixed baseline upon which tests can reliably and repeatedly execute.

    * @pytest.fixture()
    - Execute specific method before every test method

    * @pytest.yield_fixture()
    - Execute specific method before and after every test method
