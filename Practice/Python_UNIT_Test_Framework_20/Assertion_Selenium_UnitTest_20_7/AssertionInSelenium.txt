* Assertion in unit-test python with selenium
    - Assertion is nothing but the check point or you can say it as verification for the test case to evaluate some
      item on the execution
    - If we do not provide any assertion inside a test case then there is no way to know whether a test case is
      failed or not
    - Assertion helps in report generations, based on the assertions the test execution report will be
      generated.
    - There are few assertion which will accept all the values and few assertions will accept only numeric values.

* assertEqual & assertNotEqual (20_7_1)
    1. assertEqual --> assertEqual compare the first parameter with the second parameter, if both matches the unittest
                       will continue with the remaining execution but the both values are different then unit test
                       fails the testcase.

    2. assertNotEqual --> assertNotEqual method compares the given two parameters, if both parameter are not same
                          then unittest passes the testcase but if both parameter are same then unit test fails
                          the testcase.

* assertTrue & assertFalse (20_7_2)
    1. assertTrue --> - When we have only two parameter we can use assertEqual method to check whether both are same
                      or not, but if we have more than two parameters, comparing values with assertEqual method
                      become more difficult.
                      - assertTrue method checks whether given parameter is true or not, if value is true then test
                      is passed otherwise test is failed.

    2. assertFalse --> - assertFalse method compares whether given value or expression results in False or not.
                       - if the result or value is False then unittest passes the testcase but if the result
                       or value is True then unittest fails the testcase.

* assertIsNone & assertIsNotNone (20_7_3)
    1. assertIsNone --> assertIsNone method verifies whether given values or expression results is None or Not,
                        if the result is None then python unittest will pass the testcase otherwise fails the
                        testcase.

    2. assertIsNotNone --> assertIsNotNone method verifies whether given values is not None, if the value
                             is None then the testcase will be failed.

* assertIn & assertNotIn (20_7_4)
    1. assertIn --> assertIn method verifies whether the first element is present in the second element, if first
                    element is present in second element then test is passed otherwise test is failed.

    2. assertNotIn --> assertNotIn method verifies whether the first element is not present in the second element or
                       not, if first element is present then test will be failed otherwise test is passed.

    ==> These two methods will be helpful when you want to verify presence of a value in a list, tuple, set,
        and dictionary.
