* Assertion in unit-test python with selenium
    - Assertion is nothing but the check point or you can say it as verification for the test case to evaluate some
      item on the execution
    - If we do not provide any assertion inside a test case then there is no way to know whether a test case is
      failed or not
    - Assertion helps in report generations, based on the assertions the test execution report will be
      generated.
    - There are few assertion which will accept all the values and few assertions will accept only numeric values.

* assertEqual & assertNotEqual (20_7_1)
    1. assertEqual --> assertEqual compare the first parameter with the second parameter, if both matches the unittest
                       will continue with the remaining execution but the both values are different then unit test
                       fails the testcase

    2. assertNotEqual --> assertNotEqual method compares the given two parameters, if both parameter are not same
                          then unittest passes the test case but if both parameter are same then unit test fails
                          the test case
