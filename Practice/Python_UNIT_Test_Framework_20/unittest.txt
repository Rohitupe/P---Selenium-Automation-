* unitTest 1.1
 --> In automation testing, organizing your code is very important and client expects us to write
 automation scripts according to the manual test cases.
 --> We can get good reporting structure if we can exactly map our automation code with manual test cases.
 --> In Python we can use Unit Test testing Framework to organize our automation code and to extract reports
 --> To use the methods present in UnitTest Framework, we have to extend the Test Case class
 present in the UnitTest Module.
