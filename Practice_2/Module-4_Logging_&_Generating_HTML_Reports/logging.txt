=> Every things needs to be log in the logs files
=> different logs <-> 1. debug, 2. info, 3. warning, 4. error, 5. critical
=> we can use logging package in python to logs different types => 

=> logging will have an format like
  -> timestamp
  -> type of log => (debug, info, warning, etc...)
  -> test case name
  -> log message
  -> for e.g => 2019-04-23 12:23:43,219 : Error : test_case_name : Fatal error in submitting credit card payment on step 4.

PART_1 --> add logs in test cases
  --> import logging => package => to log messages in test cases
  --> `__name__` will get the file name for which this logged message is printed
  --> Different logging messages
  --> to specify the actual file we use filehandler
  --> in What format it should write it in the log file that we will specify here
  --> add all these log messages in file for this we use addHandler

PART_2 --> log messages in test case
  --> we are using logs instead of print statement
  --> these logs will be displayed in the html reports as well
