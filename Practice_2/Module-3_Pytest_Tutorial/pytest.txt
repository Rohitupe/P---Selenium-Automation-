1. pytest python file name should start with test_ or should end with _test
2. method name should start with test_
3. code should be wrapped in method

PART_1 -->
  -> to run all files in folder run -->
    py.test , py.test -v, py.test -v -s

  -> to run only single pytest file -->
    pytest filename.py

PART_2 --> 
  -> to run selected testcases or test files in pytest we use -->
    run selected file --> py.test filename.py -v -s
    run selected test case --> 


PART_1, PART_2 --> 
  -> run test cases which have cred in their method name
  --> pytest -k cred -v -s --> -k stands for key word --> will search for key word in methods name


PART_3 -->
  -> to run test based upon smoke and regression then we have to gruop tests which we want to run
  -> we can use mark concept which there in pytest to pmark particular tests as smoke or regression based upon our requirements
  -> marking test which we want to run
    --> to mark any test with specific name add decorator on method like ==> @pytest.mark.nameYouWant
    --> to run in terminal --> pytest -m smoke -v -s
  -> skipping tests
    --> to skip any test add one more decorator as ==> @pytest.mark.skip
  -> skip test and don't show warnings or any message related to this tes in console
    --> @pytest.mark.xfail
  -> conditional skipping test
    -->
